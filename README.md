My solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020), written in Rust. The code requires Rust nightly to run.

To run a solution for a particular day, first save the puzzle input to `src/bin/<day>.txt`, then run `cargo run --bin <day> --release`. The input is loaded at compile time.

If inputs for all 25 days are provided, you can run a benchmark using the `benchmark_all.sh` script.
